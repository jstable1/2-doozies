## User Experience
Users will first signup for an account by clicking on the "Signup" button on the top right of the page. Once a user has an account they can login and start to create their to-do list. They can add a task by typing the task in the box that says "Add a task here!" and pressing the button that says "Submit Task!". When a task is completed users will check the box next to the task and then at midnight every night the completed tasks are removed from the database.
